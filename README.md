DRY - Script generator framework for project setup and deployment support
========================

You are so bored with many repeated tasks whenever you setup new projects. Most of the tasks like:
+ Create project folder on the demo, staging server
+ Clone project source code from a specific template, but changing the configuration for the new project.
+ Setup and add appropriate developers into the repository...

Ok, you got my pains! That's the reason I want to develop this project.

1) Architecture of DRY
----------------------------------
DRY is composed by below components:

+ A script generator and execution (for now, we support bash script only).
You will write a script in twig template with a configuration on input constraints.
Btw, you can create a simple JSON file if you're lazy to input value on the console.

+ Some built in commands that you can inject to your script to setup bitbucket repository, users.


2) Installing DRY
