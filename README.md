DRY - Script generator framework for project setup and deployment support
========================

You are so bored with many repeated tasks whenever you setup new projects. Most of the tasks like:
+ Create project folder on the demo, staging server
+ Clone project source code from a specific template, but changing the configuration for the new project.
+ Setup and add appropriate developers into the repository.

Ok, you got my pains! That's the reason I want to develop this project.
